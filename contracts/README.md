# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Deploy ERC20 MyToken:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyToken.ts
```

Deployed contract:
- MyToken: 0xab809CB0aB6669d51f6189432f751f1a916a10cd, Tx deployed: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x696649a38eb6ce376300b6433957a04c4c8c1136b8e3878b5e03443270847a3b
